        <p>I think the hardest part of being young is not knowing what you want to do with your life. The 
          idea of putting yourself out there and trying everything and take what fits you best is a part of late 
          teenage years. Needless do I say that self esteem issue, self doubt and struggling with confidence is part of this age
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3 class="h3-heading">2019-2021</h3>
      <p>Reality kicks in and there is pressure from all angles; from peers and parants who think you should have
        your life figured out. Looking at your agemates who have their life figured out makes it even harder to
        stick to your course since you want to fit in what career they pursue.
      </p>
    </div>
     <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3 class="h3-heading">2021-Date</h3>
    <p>And finally you find a world called tech where you can build, design and make ideas in your mind turn into something
      people can view. Now you feel happy and intrigued and what to create and design more and more. In the process
     you start feeling confident and want to showcase your project to world. </p>
